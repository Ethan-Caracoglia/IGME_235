    <h3>Story</h3>
    <p>
        In this game you are subjected to a punishment similar to Sisyphus in hell. Your boulder <br>
        will be the relentless crowd of enemies that have no end.
    </p>

    <h3>Style</h3>
    <p>
        The style of this game is intended to be extremely simple as the focus is going to be on <br>
        using stick figures and hand drawn objects in a sketch-like art style. Color will be used to denote <br>
        the players and different types of enemies. 
    </p>

    <h3>Gameplay</h3>
    <p>
        The gameplay will be pretty standard for a shoot 'em up type of game with a top down view. <br>
        It will feature at least 3 differnt types of weapons and enemies which vary between being <br>
        ranged and melee based. With each wave the number and strength of enemies will grow up until <br>
        a point where the enemies plateau and only their numbers increase.
    </p>

    <h3>Controls</h3>
    <p>
        The player will be able to move using the "WASD" keys as well as the arrow keys. They will <br>
        attack in whatever direction they are facing using "J" or "SPACEBAR".
    </p>
