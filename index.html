        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <p class="para">
            Hello there! My name is Ethan Caracoglia! I am student at Rochester Institute of Technology<br>
            majoring in Game Design and Development. Although I am in game design, my main passion is<br>
            coding in general. I want to become great at programming gameplay systems and artificial<br>
            for non player characters in video games as well as embedded development for firmwarel. I<br>
            hope that after I graduate I will be able to start my own indie game development studio that<br>
            that creates games with nuerotechnology such as an EEG interface. I believe that this web<br>
            class will help me achive proper advertisement for such a thing.
