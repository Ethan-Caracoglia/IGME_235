            <h3>Greatsword</h3>
            <img src="media/weaponGIFs/greatsword.gif" alt="GreatswordGIF">
            <p>
                The Greatsword is the high risk high reward weapon of the series. It focuses on slow 
                descisive hits that when successful result in massive damage numbers. It is the ideal 
                weapon for those who enjoy taking it slow as they will surely have fun biding their 
                time in preperation for unleashing the weighty hits of the true charge slash combo.
            </p>

            <h3>Longsword</h3>
            <img src="media/weaponGIFs/longsword.gif" alt="LongswordGIF">
            <p>
                The Longsword is the flowiest weapon of this game. It comes with many attacks that 
                allow it to move around such as the fade slash. It also comes with attacks that 
                counter the monster such as the foresight slash which allows you to add a level to 
                your spirit gauge. When you have three spirit gauge levels, it is time to unleash 
                the mighty spirit helm-breaker. This weapon is best for those who want to dance 
                right through the monsters attaks.
            </p>

        <div class="l3" id="l3">
            <h3>Sword & Shield</h3>
            <img src="media/weaponGIFs/swordAndShield.gif" alt="SwordAndShieldGIF">
            <p>
                The Sword and Shield is a weapon praised by both the newbies and the veterans of the 
                series as it is a weapon that has a low skill floor and a high skill ceiling. It uses 
                both the sword and the shield for attacking causing both slashing damage and blunt 
                damage to be done to the monster. It has many bread and butter combos, but none are 
                as revered as the shield bash and the perfect rush combos. This is a weapon that 
                almsot anyone can pivk up and have a blast with.
            </p>

        <div class="l4" id="l4">
            <h3>Dual Blades</h3>
            <img src="media/weaponGIFs/dualBlades.gif" alt="DualBladesGIF">
            <p>
                The Dual Blades are the weapon of speed in this game. If you can't sit still or don't 
                want to wait for the monster to finish attacking to get your licks in then fear not 
                for this is your weapon right here. The dual blades can enter their demon mode which 
                makes you an extremely mobile blender of monster meat that is only held back by the 
                drain on your stamina.
            </p>

        <div class="l5" id="l5">
            <h3>Hammer</h3>
            <img src="media/weaponGIFs/hammer.gif" alt="HammerGIF">
            <p> 
                The Hammer is the KO weapon of this game. It deals blunt damage which while good for 
                breaking certain monster parts, it is best for giving the monster a concussion and 
                sending it tumbling to the ground. The weapon hits hard plays harder. If you want to 
                knock-out some behemoths with a rock on a stick, this is the weapon for you.
            </p>

            <h3>Hunting Horn</h3>
            <img src="media/weaponGIFs/huntingHorn.gif" alt="HuntingHornGIF">
            <p>
                The Hunting Horn is the support weapon of this game. It uses songs to apply different 
                buffs to you and your fellow hunters. Don't be fooled though. It might be considered 
                a support weapon, but that is only true if you are playing with other people. If you 
                are along it becomes a sonourus blunt baseball bat that KOs monsters like the hammer, 
                but also fills with the power of its music.
            </p>

        <div class="l7" id="l7">
            <h3>Lance</h3>
            <img src="media/weaponGIFs/lance.gif" alt="LanceGIF">
            <p>
                The Lance is the weapon chosen by those that like to tank hits and send them right back.
                While its moveset might be underwhelming at first glance, it has some depth that many 
                people don't get to see. It is the other main counter weapon of this game as it aborbs 
                hits from the monster and throws it right back at its face every chance it gets. Pick 
                this weapon if you like the idea of being an impenetrable wall.
            </p>

        <div class="l8" id="l8">
            <h3>Gunlance</h3>
            <img src="media/weaponGIFs/gunlance.gif" alt="GunlanceGIF">
            <p>
                The Gunlance is less gun and lance more like a lance with explosions coming out of the 
                tip. This weapon can completely bypass the armor of a monster with its shelling and 
                wyvernstake attacks. It is the best weapon if you love explosions as that is where it 
                shines. Especially with the powerful full burst and wyvern fire attacks.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="l9" id="l9">
            <h3>Switch Axe</h3>
            <img src="media/weaponGIFs/switchAxe.gif" alt="SwitchAxeGIF">
            <p>
                The Switch Axe is one of the two morph weapons of this game. It switches between an axe 
                and a sword. The axe mode is quite mobile and allows for quick attacks and swift rolls. 
                The sword mode restricts your movment a bit more, but the tradeoff is heavenly flurries 
                which charge the sword up to do its zero element discharge attack which causes you to 
                latch onto the monsters and release the stored up energy into a massive explosion.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="l10" id="l10">
            <h3>Charge Blade</h3>
            <img src="media/weaponGIFs/chargeBlade.gif" alt="ChargeBladeGIF">
            <p>
                The Charge Blade is the second morph weapon that was introduced into this game. It 
                switches between a sword and shield and an axe. It uses the sword mode to charge up 
                its five phials which can then be stored in the shield. Once you store the phials in 
                the shield you can either switch into axe mode, savage axe mode, or you can release 
                all the phials at once using the Ultra Amped Element Discharge attack which causes
                massive explosions in its wake.
            </p>

        <div class="l11" id="l11">
            <h3>Insect Glaive</h3>
            <img src="media/weaponGIFs/insectGlaive.gif" alt="InsectGlaiveGIF">
            <p>
                The Insect Glaive straight up allows you to fly through the air. It uses an kinsect 
                buddy to gather buffs from the monster which enhance the offense and defense of the 
                weapon and even its moveset. This weapon is the ideal pick for those who like to 
                think the floor is lava.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="l12" id="l12">
            <h3>Light Bowgun</h3>
            <img src="media/weaponGIFs/lightBowgun.gif" alt="LightBowgunGIF">
            <p>
                The Light Bowgun is the evasive little brother to the Heavy Bowgun. It shoots a myriad 
                of different ammo types and can place mines down to shoot and cause them to explode. 
                It is one of the most nimble weapons of the game with its slide reload and its ability 
                to keep a strong distance from the monster. This weapon is best for those who like to 
                stay at range from their enemy.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="l13" id="l13">
            <h3>Heavy Bowgun</h3>
            <img src="media/weaponGIFs/heavyBowgun.gif" alt="HeavyBowgunGIF">
            <p>
                The Heavy Bowgun is the heavy hitting and slower older brother to Light Bowgun. Along 
                with its many different ammo types, it can use two different types of special ammo. 
                Some have the wyvern snipe ammo which allow for one massive piercing shot through the 
                mosnter. Others have the wyvern heart ammo which turns your heavy bowgun into a machine 
                gun.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="l14" id="l14">
            <h3>Bow</h3>
            <img src="media/weaponGIFs/bow.gif" alt="BowGIF">
            <p>
                The Bow allows you to essentially dance around the monster as you unload arrows upon 
                it. This weapon is ideal for those who love to stay moving like the dual blades, but 
                don't want to get nearly as close. Although your stamina will drain like crazy, you 
                can remain untouchable by the monster if you play your cards right.

            <p>
                The Medium Bowgun, Tonfas, Magnet Spike, and Accel Axe are relics of the past at this 
                point. They are no longer featured in the current generation of Monter Hunter games, but 
                they desereved an honorable mention nonetheless.
